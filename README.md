Portfolio website for software project display

Users may create a profile that displays many personal artifacts about them as
well as many professional achievements that he or she has accumulated over the
years.

This website will allow users to link projects to their profile and even their
github account. They can upload executables for their projects so that employers
may see the whole project work.
